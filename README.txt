As of the time of this writing, I do not recommend using this in any environment, development or production.  This is just me hacking on an idea, a framework for building masterless, distributed applications.

There are no stable versions, and I add in things for fun.  

I will not accept patches, this project is mostly about writing the code myself.

What's the end goal?

A library I can use to develop toy dbs.  A firm understanding of Cython, metaclasses.  Distributed graphs, consensus algorithms.
